# Cairo finite element

This library is a finite element implementation in Cairo. Given the computation capabilities of Starknet, a finite element calculation could be done on Starknet.

# Testing

Testing as been run on [protostar](https://github.com/software-mansion/protostar) 0.7.0 and tests can be run with `protostar test tests`

# TODO

-   [ ] Second degree interpolation on triangular elements
-   [ ] First and second degree interpolation on quadrilateral elements
-   [ ] Hammer 3 point integration
-   [ ] Integratin test over mesh
